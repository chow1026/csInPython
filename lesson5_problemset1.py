# 6. In video 28. Update, it was suggested that some of the duplicate code in
# lookup and update could be avoided by a better design.  We can do this by
# defining a procedure that finds the entry corresponding to a given key, and
# using that in both lookup and update.

# Here are the original procedures:
def keypair_lookup(htable, key):
    bucket = hashtable_get_bucket(htable, key)
    for entry in bucket:
        if entry[0] == key:
            return entry
    return None

def hashtable_update(htable, key, value):
    entry = keypair_lookup(htable, key)
    print(entry)
    if entry != None:
        entry[1] = value
    else:
        bucket = hashtable_get_bucket(htable, key)
        bucket.append([key, value])

def hashtable_lookup(htable, key):
    entry = keypair_lookup(htable, key)
    if entry != None:
        return entry[1]
    else:
        return None

def make_hashtable(size):
    table = []
    for unused in range(0, size):
        table.append([])
    return table

def hash_string(s, size):
    h = 0
    for c in s:
         h = h + ord(c)
    return h % size

def hashtable_get_bucket(htable, key):
    return htable[hash_string(key, len(htable))]

# Whenever we have duplicate code like the loop that finds the entry in
# hashtable_update and hashtable_lookup, we should think if there is a better way
# to write this that would avoid the duplication. We should be able to rewrite
# these procedures to be shorter by defining a new procedure and rewriting both
# hashtable_update and hashtable_lookup to use that procedure.

# Modify the code for both hashtable_update and hashtable_lookup to have the same
# behavior they have now, but using fewer lines of code in each procedure.  You
# should define a new procedure to help with this. Your new version should have
# approximately the same running time as the original version, but neither
# hashtable_update or hashtable_lookup should include any for or while loop, and
# the block of each procedure should be no more than 6 lines long.

# Your procedures should have the same behavior as the originals.  For example,

table = make_hashtable(10)
hashtable_update(table, 'Python', 'Monty')
hashtable_update(table, 'CLU', 'Barbara Liskov')
hashtable_update(table, 'JavaScript', 'Brendan Eich')
hashtable_update(table, 'Python', 'Guido van Rossum')
print hashtable_lookup(table, 'Python')
#>>> Guido van Rossum





# [Double Gold Star] Memoization is a way to make code run faster by saving
# previously computed results.  Instead of needing to recompute the value of an
# expression, a memoized computation first looks for the value in a cache of
# pre-computed values.

# Define a procedure, cached_execution(cache, proc, proc_input), that takes in
# three inputs: a cache, which is a Dictionary that maps inputs to proc to
# their previously computed values, a procedure, proc, which can be called by
# just writing proc(proc_input), and proc_input which is the input to proc.
# Your procedure should return the value of the proc with input proc_input,
# but should only evaluate it if it has not been previously called.

def cached_execution(cache, proc, proc_input):
    # Your code here
    if proc not in cache:
        result = eval(str(proc(proc_input)))
        cache[proc] = result
        return result
    else:
        return cache[proc]

# Here is an example showing the desired behavior of cached_execution:

def factorial(n):
    print "Running factorial"
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i
    return result

cache = {} # start cache as an empty dictionary
### first execution (should print out Running factorial and the result)
print cached_execution(cache, factorial, 50)

print "Second time:"
### second execution (should only print out the result)
print cached_execution(cache, factorial, 50)

# Here is a more interesting example using cached_execution
# (do not worry if you do not understand this, though,
# it will be clearer after Unit 6):

def cached_fibo(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 0:
        return n
    else:
        return (cached_execution(cache, cached_fibo, n - 1 )
               + cached_execution(cache,  cached_fibo, n - 2 ))

cache = {} # new cache for this procedure
# do not try this at home...at least without a cache!
print "New Cache for Cached_fibo"
print cached_execution(cache, cached_fibo,100)
